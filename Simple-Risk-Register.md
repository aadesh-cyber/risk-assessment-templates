## 📌 Risk Table

| **Asset**         | **Threat**        | **Vulnerability**              | **Likelihood (1-5)** | **Impact (1-5)** | **Risk Score (L×I)** | **Controls**                                | **Residual Risk** |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Web Application   | SQL Injection     | Unpatched Input Field          | 4                    | 5                | 20                     | Input validation, WAF rules                 | Medium             |
| Database Server   | Data Breach       | Unencrypted Storage            | 3                    | 5                | 15                     | Encryption at rest, access control          | Low                |
| User Credentials  | Credential Theft  | Weak Password Policy           | 5                    | 4                | 20                     | Enforce MFA, password complexity            | Medium             |

## 📘 Definitions

- **Asset**: The IT resource or system under assessment.
- **Threat**: A potential event or attacker causing harm (e.g. hacker, malware).
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that could be exploited (e.g. poor patching).
- **Likelihood**: Probability of the threat exploiting the vulnerability (1 = Rare, 5 = Very Likely).
- **Impact**: Potential severity of the impact if exploited (1 = Negligible, 5 = Critical).
- **Risk Score**: Product of Likelihood × Impact. Helps prioritize response.
- **Controls**: Measures taken to reduce risk (technical or administrative).
- **Residual Risk**: The risk level that remains after applying controls.

## 🧮 Risk Scoring Matrix

| **Likelihood ↓ / Impact →** | 1 (Low) | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5 (High) |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **1 (Rare)**                | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5         |
| **2 (Unlikely)**            | 2       | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10        |
| **3 (Possible)**            | 3       | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15        |
| **4 (Likely)**              | 4       | 8       | 12      | 16      | 20        |
| **5 (Very Likely)**         | 5       | 10      | 15      | 20      | 25        |

- **Low Risk**: 1–6  
- **Medium Risk**: 7–14  
- **High Risk**: 15–25

## ✅ Why These Controls?

- SQL Injection is a critical web threat; **input validation** and **WAF** are proven first lines of defense.
- **Database encryption** and **access control** reduce the blast radius in case of breaches.
- For user credentials, enforcing **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and strong password policies improves resilience to phishing and brute-force attacks.
